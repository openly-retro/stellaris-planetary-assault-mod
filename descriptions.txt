This mod adds exclusive ship types which can invade planets automatically.
It also adds a component which let military ship to invade planet by itself without transport.

Yes, with this mod, you don't need those transports to invade planets anymore.

Order your ship with the 'Orbital Drop Pod' Component to start orbital bombardment on the target planet.
When planet devastation is reached a particular percentage, then the automatic invasion will begin.
(Invasion can be started again after 3 months if ground combat is not happening on the target planet.)

Default devastation percent to initiate automatic invasion is 25%.
(You can change this in the 'Planetary Assault Ship & Army Mod Panel' edict.)

Automatically dropped armies can't retreat and will be removed after ground combat is finished.

[h1] 'Drop Pod Size' Components [/h1]
[b] Small Drop Pod [/b]
Drops 1 army to ground at one time.
Unlocked by 'New Orbital Drop Pod' technology.

[b] Medium Drop Pod [/b]
Drops 2 army to ground at one time.
Unlocked by 'Planetary Assault Ship Design technology.

[b] Large Drop Pod [/b]
Drops 3 army to ground at one time.
Unlocked by 'Massive Assault Carrier Design' technology.


[h1] 'Planetary Assault Army Type' Components [/h1]
These components set types of the actual army that will be dropped to the planet.


[h1] 'Small Orbital Drop Pod' Component [/h1]
This 'aux' component can be equipped in normal military ships and can carry different army types.
But only 1 unit of the same army type can be dropped.

For example:
If the ship has 2 'Small Orbital Drop Pod' components that carry the same 'Orbital Drop Drone' army type, then only 1 'Orbital Drop Drone' army will be dropped to the planet.

However, if the ship has 1 drop pod carrying the 'Orbital Drop Drone' army type and another one carrying the 'Artillery Drone Unit' army type, then 1 'Orbital Drop Drone' army and the 'Artillery Drone Unit' army will be dropped to the planet together.

The reason for this weird limitation is that the current game engine doesn't support 'Number of the same component equipped in the ship' as a condition. In other words, I can use 'whether the ship has a certain component or not' as a condition, but I can't use 'how many components of the same type the ship has' as a condition.


This is all. Thank you for reading this so far, and ask me freely if you want to. :)
